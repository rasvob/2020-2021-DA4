## Lecture 3 - Forecasting
This lecture is about basics of the time series forecasting. We will discuss the natural gas consumption forecasting topic using provided dataset. The lecture will demonstrate usage of basic statistical and machine learning algorithms as well as common preprocessing techniques.

## Lecture 4 - Deep learning in forecasting domain
This lecture is about the time series forecasting using deep learning models. We will discuss the natural gas consumption forecasting topic using provided dataset once again and we will utilize LSTM as well as CNN models for both single- and multi-step forecasting.
